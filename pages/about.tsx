          I was born in 2000 and from a young age, I was fascinated by
          computers. Even as a kindergartener, I couldn't take my eyes off the
          screen of the Toshiba laptop that my father brought home.

          Although we didn't have internet at home until I was in sixth grade, I
          continued to tinker with the computer, though it was usually finishing
          the Warcraft III campaign numerous times (which perhaps explains my
          success at MOBA games).

          As I grew older, my interest in computers only deepened. When I
          enrolled in a computer engineering program at university, I quickly
          became enthusiastic with coding and web development in particular.
          Since then, I've been pursuing my passion for web development with
          enthusiasm and a commitment to constantly learning and growing as a
          developer.

        <p className="mt-2">
          During my free time, I like to explore the latest technologies and
          trends in the field of web development, as well as continuously
          improving my skills with existing ones. I also enjoy playing video
          games for brainshifting and relaxing.
